## Conservation_potential_of_the_matrix
This repository includes `Python` code used to reproduce the analyses for the manuscript:

**"Matrix areas reveal conservation opportunities for over half of the world’s terrestrial mammals"**

_by J.P. Ramírez-Delgado, M. Di Marco, C.J. Johnson, J.E.M. Watson, L. de Assis Barros, and O. Venter_

### Requirements
Users should have `ArcGIS Pro` version 3.4.0 or higher.  
Scripts use the `ArcPy` library and require the `Spatial Analyst` extension.

### Code
`Compute_species_richness.py` computes global species richness maps by summing binary habitat rasters for each species.  
Used for:
- all mammals  
- mammals with declining population trends  
- mammals with threatened status  
- suitable-habitat richness for the all-mammal group

`Hotspot_delineation.py` Identifies matrix-based richness hotspots using:
- percentile-based richness thresholds  
- iterative coverage matching  
- contiguity filtering (minimum area = 10 km²)  

### Data
The species richness rasters required to run `hotspot_delineation.py` are publicly archived on Zenodo at 

These include:
- `species_richness_matrix_all.tif`  
- `species_richness_suitable_all.tif`  
- `species_richness_within_species-rich-matrix_areas_all.tif`  
- `species_richness_within_species-rich-matrix_areas_declining.tif`  
- `species_richness_within_species-rich-matrix_areas_threatened.tif`

These derived rasters allow users to reproduce all hotspot analyses without requiring access to the original species-level AOH and range datasets.

### **Not included in this repository**
AOH-derived species rasters and IUCN Red List range maps used to delineate the extent of suitable habitat and matrix areas for each species (i.e., the inputs for `compute_species_richness.py`) are **not included** because of size and licensing restrictions.  

Other global datasets used in the study—such as the Human Footprint (HFP) dataset and spatial data on Protected Areas (PAs) and Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs)—are likewise not included here. These datasets are publicly available from their original providers, as described in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript accompanying this repository.
